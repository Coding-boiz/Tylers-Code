# Tylers-Code
This repository is for the projects that I am currently creating or doing maintenance on. You are welcome to check them out, but they are most likely filled with bugs and errors. 

# What are the different generations?
The different generation folders are the version of the project. Even minor changes can get a file switched to another generation.
